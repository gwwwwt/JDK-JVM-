# MacOS 动态链接库相关API应用



## 示例函数 SetExecname()

> **源码: java_md_macosx.m**
>
> > **函数作用:  在调用'java xxx' 运行程序时，'java'命令可能只是一个软链接或基于$PATH的相对路径，即并非以完整的绝对路径方式来指定可执行文件，但在JVM中又需要根据java命令的绝对路径来做一些操作，例如确定jvm动态链接库位置并加载，这样就需要一种方式来获取这个绝对路径。**
> >
> > **参考下面 SetExecname() 函数的注释，操作系统中有提供类似 getexecname() 的系统调用来获取命令的绝对路径，但是这个API在 Solaris系统中可能并不会正常工作。所以这里 SetExecname() 采用另外一种方式: `不管java是绝对路径还是软链接等，程序运行起来时就表示可执行文件已经被加载进入内存，根据已加载的可执行程序，调用dladdr 系统调用的方式来确定可执行文件入口 main() 函数的信息，而这个信息中就包含了可执行文件的实际绝对路径。`**

```c

static char *execname = NULL; //相关全局变量

/*
 * Compute the name of the executable
 *
 * In order to re-exec securely we need the absolute path of the
 * executable. On Solaris getexecname(3c) may not return an absolute
 * path so we use dladdr to get the filename of the executable and
 * then use realpath to derive an absolute path. From Solaris 9
 * onwards the filename returned in DL_info structure from dladdr is
 * an absolute pathname so technically realpath isn't required.
 * On Linux we read the executable name from /proc/self/exe.
 * As a fallback, and for platforms other than Solaris and Linux,
 * we use FindExecName to compute the executable name.
 */
const char* SetExecname(char **argv)
{
    char* exec_path = NULL;
    {
        Dl_info dlinfo;

        int (*fptr)();
        fptr = (int (*)())dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "main"); //在加载的可执行文件中搜索 main() 函数的地址, 即函数指针

        if (fptr == NULL) {
            JLI_ReportErrorMessage(DLL_ERROR3, dlerror());
            return JNI_FALSE;
        }

        if (dladdr((void*)fptr, &dlinfo)) { //获取main()函数所属的image信息, 保存到dlinfo中; 
            char *resolved = (char*)JLI_MemAlloc(PATH_MAX+1);
            if (resolved != NULL) {
                exec_path = realpath(dlinfo.dli_fname, resolved); //dlinfo.dli_fname中就是image的完整路径
                if (exec_path == NULL) {
                    JLI_MemFree(resolved);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if (exec_path == NULL) {
        //如果上面使用dladdr的方式没有找到完整路径, 再检查argv[0]是否是绝对路径, 是否可以通过PATH的方式获取到
        exec_path = FindExecName(argv[0]); 
    }
    execname = exec_path;
    return exec_path;
}

### 1.1 dlsym 

> **获取符号地址（变量或函数）**

```shell
NAME
     dlsym -- get address of a symbol

SYNOPSIS
     #include <dlfcn.h>

     void*
     dlsym(void* handle, const char* symbol);

DESCRIPTION
     dlsym() returns the address of the code or data location specified by the null-terminated character string
     symbol.  Which libraries and bundles are searched depends on the handle parameter.

     If dlsym() is called with a handle, returned by dlopen() then only that image and any libraries it depends
     on are searched for symbol.

     If dlsym() is called with the special handle RTLD_DEFAULT, then all mach-o images in the process (except
     those loaded with dlopen(xxx, RTLD_LOCAL)) are searched in the order they were loaded.  This can be a
     costly search and should be avoided.

     If dlsym() is called with the special handle RTLD_NEXT, then dyld searches for the symbol in the dylibs the
     calling image linked against when built. It is usually used when you intentionally have multiply defined
     symbol across images and want to find the "next" definition.  It searches other images for the definition
     that the caller would be using if it did not have a definition.  The exact search algorithm depends on
     whether the caller's image was linked -flat_namespace or -twolevel_namespace.  For flat linked images, the
     search starts in the load ordered list of all images, in the image right after the caller's image.  For
     two-level images, the search simulates how the static linker would have searched for the symbol when link-
     ing the caller's image.

     If dlsym() is called with the special handle RTLD_SELF, then the search for the symbol starts with the
     image that called dlsym().  If it is not found, the search continues as if RTLD_NEXT was used.

     If dlsym() is called with the special handle RTLD_MAIN_ONLY, then it only searches for symbol in the main
     executable.

RETURN VALUES
     The dlsym() function returns a null pointer if the symbol cannot be found, and sets an error condition
     which may be queried with dlerror().

```



### 1.2 dladdr

> **根据地址获取该地址所属的image信息**

```shell
NAME
     dladdr -- find the image containing a given address

SYNOPSIS
     #include <dlfcn.h>

     int
     dladdr(const void* addr, Dl_info* info);

DESCRIPTION
     The dladdr() function queries dyld (the dynamic linker) for information about the image containing the
     address addr.  The information is returned in the structure specified by info.  The structure contains at
     least the following members:

     const char* dli_fname     The pathname of the shared object containing the address.

     void* dli_fbase           The base address (mach_header) at which the image is mapped into the address
                               space of the calling process.
    
     const char* dli_sname     The name of the nearest run-time symbol with a value less than or equal to addr.

     void* dli_saddr           The value of the symbol returned in dli_sname.

     The dladdr() function is available only in dynamically linked programs.

ERRORS
     If an image containing addr cannot be found, dladdr() returns 0.  On success, a non-zero value is returned.

     If the image containing addr is found, but no nearest symbol was found, the dli_sname and dli_saddr fields
		 are set to NULL.
